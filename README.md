# UI-Design-Minimalist-Tutorial
Simple UI tutorial to learn the fundamentals of User Interface Design.



#What is UI Design?

A digital medium that a user interacts with. UI Design is all about creativity!



#UI vs UX Design

UI is visual, from screens, pages and visual elements.

UX is focused on the user's experience while they're interacting with your product or service

UX is focused on the user's journey to solve a prolem, UI is focused on how a product's surface look and function

UI is the bridge that gets us where we want to go, UX is the feeling we get when arrive

A UX designer is concerned with the conceptual aspects of the design process, leaving the UI designer to focus on the more tangible elements



#UI Design vs Frontend developer

A UI Designer handles designing and prototyping the screen, while a frontend developer takes those designs and uses HTML, CSS & Javascript to make them work on our device



#Design Fundamentals

- Color & Contrast
- White Space
- Visual Hierarchy
- Complexity vs Simplicity
- Consistency
- Scale



#Color & Contrast

The color choice is a decision that makes the greatest visual impression, so according to what feeling we want to generate, we'll choose one color or another. 

Will we choose warm or cold colors? 

Will we use shocking colors like red for a presentation portfolio?

The color and its symbolism is associate with our cultural perception.

The contrast will separate the elements and will help to identify them and clear things up.
A simple and clear message will come from elements that are separate from each other.



#White Space

The use of white space will make all the elements and sub-elements much clear, readable and attractive to the eyes. 

Not saturating everything, The message must be clear and well presented, we'll think about this concept permanently when we're designing.



#Visual Hierarchy

What do we want to see first? When we think about order, we're thinking about visual hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is all about separating the core elements, from the header to the concent.
Setting up every element where we would like to see them, to create the right blocks in its right positions.



#Complexity vs Simplicity

There's no point of creating something complicated for no reason.

The main tendency in web designing, and not only web design ;) is Minimalism.

It's all about simplify things out, wiping all non important things and creating a simply and effective content.

The baroque era happened centuries of years ago!

Nowadays, we're looking for simple and effective things. It's a beautiful concept isn't it?



#Consistency

The concept of consistency is about unifying all elements of our design in the same concept! 

That includes using the same color range, fonts and schema, basically create the same feel and design for the user. 

Can you imagine one element of our website in black and white and other fill with colors and different fonts?



#Scale

Following the concept of consistency, we wont want some big elements next to others that are hardly visible.

Therefore, even when some elements are bigger than others, they'll maintain similar proportions, no matter their differences.

Same scale, different sizes!
